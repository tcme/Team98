Hey Prakash, 
Inside this document I have provided a few documents that show I am contributing to the project. 

They should be as follows:

  Currently this is on my local repo and on GitHub (although not updated uet), but here I added a searchbar and edited some of    David's dummy code (including editing SQL queries) to make a working search page. I also implemented the inline searchbar to    make it even in the navbar. I will be implementing the collapsed interface soon, which is at this stage in development.

  Implemented an FAQ page for the website and linked it to the main page (see footer). Eloise will be adding the FAQs to make 
  it a completed page, which is hoped to be completed soon. Leon's work and the structure from the other pages helped me with   
  implement the Bootstrap for the columns and it was simple enough to develop. It does create business value by making the 
  process of answering common questions quite simple.
